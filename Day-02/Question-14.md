# Problem Statement:

Write a program that compares two input numbers and determines which one is larger or if they are equal.

## Requirements:

Compare the numbers using conditional statements. Print which number is larger or if they are the same in a clear, formatted string.

### Test Cases:

### Test Case 1:

number1 = 5, number2 = 10. Expected output: "10 is larger than 5"

### Test Case 2:

number1 = 7, number2 = 7. Expected output: "Both numbers are equal"

### Test Case 3:

number1 = -1, number2 = -10. Expected output: "-1 is larger than -10"

# Edge Cases:

## Edge Case 1:

What if both numbers are zero? Expected output: "Both numbers are equal"

## Edge Case 2:

What if the numbers are negative? The logic should still correctly identify which is larger or if they are equal.
