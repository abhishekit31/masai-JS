# Problem Statement:

A store offers a 10% discount on items priced more than $20. Develop a program to calculate and display the final price after the discount if applicable.

## Requirements:

Apply a 10% discount if the price is greater than $20. Print the final price formatted as: "The final price of the item is: Y" where Y is the price after any applicable discounts.

## Test Cases:

## Test Case 1:

original price = $25. Expected output: "The final price of the item is: 22.5"

## Test Case 2:

original price = $20. Expected output: "The final price of the item is: 20"

## Test Case 3:

original price = $15. Expected output: "The final price of the item is: 15"

### Edge Cases:

### Edge Case 1:

What if the price is exactly $20? The output should show no discount applied.

### Edge Case 2:

What if the price is a negative number? The program should handle this by printing: "Invalid price, the price must be a non-negative number."
