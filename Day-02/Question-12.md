# Problem Statement:

Write a program that calculates the area of a triangle given the base and the height. The area is determined using the formula: Area = (Base X Height)/2

## Requirements:

Calculate the area using the formula provided. Print the result in a formatted string like: "The area of the triangle is: X" where X is the calculated area.

## Test Cases:

Test Case 1: base = 10, height = 5. Expected output: "The area of the triangle is: 25.0"

## Test Case 2:

base = 0, height = 15. Expected output: "The area of the triangle is: 0.0"

## Test Case 3:

base = 8, height = 0. Expected output: "The area of the triangle is: 0.0"

## Edge Cases:

### Edge Case 1:

What happens if one or both variables are zero? The output should be 0.0, as this represents a triangle with no area.

### Edge Case 2:

What if negative variables are entered? The program should handle this by printing: "Invalid number, base and height must be positive numbers."
